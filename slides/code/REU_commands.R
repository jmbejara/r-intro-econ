## SETTING THE WORKING DIRECTORY
# setwd("C:/Users/Test/Dropbox/Teaching/REU/Code/R")

# This is useful when you plan to import code or data from other files. Setting 
# the working directory tells R where to look for those files when you haven't 
# specified a complete path, and where to save output from the current session.


## CLEARING THE WORKSPACE
rm(list = ls())


## SIMPLE CALCULATIONS
1 + 1
2 * 3
2 * pi


## RUNNING CODE FROM AN .R FILE
# We could have typed this into the command line, but instead we run it by 
# selecting the relevant lines of code, and then pressing CTRL+Enter.

# Alternatively, select the lines of code you want to run and hit "Run" in the 
# upper-right corner of this part of the interface.

# Using CTRL+Shift+Enter, the code is run from the top.

# Every line starting with '#' is a 'comment', not seen as executable code by R.


## COMMAND HISTORY
# The top-right panel has a tab called 'History'. Here, you can see every line
# of code that you put to the command line. You can copy-paste from here.

# You can also pull up previous commands by placing your cursor on the command 
# line and repeatedly pressing the 'up' arrow until you find the command you 
# want.

# Using tab on the command allows command completion.


## WORKSPACE
# There is another tab called 'Environment'. This is where you can see a list of 
# objects that are in your workspace. Currently, there is nothing in our 
# workspace. Let's add some things:
x <- 1
s <- "abc"

# This is called variable assignment.

# Later, you can choose to save all the items in your workspace in a file. 
# This is convenient if some of the data objects are the result of time-consuming 
# calculations.


## HELP
# In the bottom-left panel, you can see a tab labeled 'Help'. If you click on
# it, you will a search field where you look up the purpose and syntax for a 
# given command.

# Often, it is easier to google the task that you are trying to complete. You
# should also consider forums like Stack Overflow.


## PLOTS
# This tab shows the output from command that generate graphics. For example:
x <- 1:100
y <- log(x)
plot(x,y) # scatter plot
plot(x,y,type = 'l') # line plot


## PACKAGES
# This tab shows a list of packages (extensions) that are available to you. 
# Sometimes, you will need to download and install a package before you can use 
# it. You can do this by clicking 'Install' and searching for the package name.

# Let's try installing a package that we will use later: stargazer. We can do
# this manually, or run this line of code:
install.packages("stargazer")

# To activate the package, either select it in the Packages tab, or run
library("stargazer")


## WRITING .R FILES AND SAVING YOUR CODE
# The code in this file can be save by clicking on 'File' and then 'Save' or 
# 'Save as'. You can start a new .R file by clicking on 'File' and then 
# 'New file' and then 'R Script'.
